2. Data analysis
================

This R project provides :ref:`R scripts` and :ref:`R notebooks` to perform basic analyses on survival datasets.

An :ref:`IPython notebook` that summarizes all the environment setup and data analysis steps is also available in the main directory. It is the easiest way to get started.


.. note:: Try to keep the code, data and result organized along the existing directory tree:

    .. include:: directory_tree.rst

.. seealso:: The :ref:`tutorial` is a great way to start!

.. include:: ../bin/README.rst

:Documentation:
    .. toctree::

IPython notebook
----------------

:Location: Main directory of the project.
:When to use:
  - Whenever keeping a trace of the global analysis process is needed.
  - In general, whenever using R scripts is appropriate.
:When not to use:
  - In general, when using a R notebook is appropriate.
